# Coffee Counter

This is a little WebApp which has been created due to demands in our office:
- how can we easily track the coffee consume of every employee;
- how can we track the individual purchases like coffee beans, milk etc.;
- how can we fairly bill every drinker and pay every buyer;
- how can we make the life easier for those who administer the whole stuff?

The coffee counter does some great job for us, and hopefully will do for you.

**Warning:** The whole texts on the UI frontend are in German, due to lack of time for translation. So these have to be adopted to your language first.
